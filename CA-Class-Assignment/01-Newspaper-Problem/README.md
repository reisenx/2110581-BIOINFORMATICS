# Assignment 1: The Newspaper Problem

# Problem Description

Your task is to perform a sequence assembly. Given the following set of short
DNA fragments, also known as "reads," your goal is to reconstruct the original,
complete DNA sequence. The final assembled sequence should be exactly 20 base
pairs (bps) long.

**Input**

```
>read_001
CCTAAGGCGC
>read_002
GCGCGGGCGC
>read_003
CTTAGGCCGC
>read_004
GGGCGCCTTA
>read_005
GCGGCCTAAG
>read_006
GCGCCCGCGC
```

**Objective**

Determine the overlapping arrangement of these reads to construct a complete DNA
sequence with exactly 20 base pairs (bps) long.
